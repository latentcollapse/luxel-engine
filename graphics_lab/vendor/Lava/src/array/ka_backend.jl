    LavaBackend <: KA.GPU

Lava's GPU compute backend. Carries the Vulkan context and batch queues explicitly.

  * `dispatch_bq`: where KA kernel dispatches are recorded.
  * `upload_bq`:   where CPU→GPU transfers (upload!, download!, staging)
                   record their copies. May be the same queue as dispatch_bq
                   (single-queue mode) or a separate async queue for true
                   upload/compute overlap.

    LavaBackend()                      # default: dispatch + upload both on default_bq
    LavaBackend(bq)                    # single queue for both
    LavaBackend(dispatch_bq, upload_bq)  # split — enables pipelining

`LavaBackend()` with no arguments resolves `dispatch_bq` / `upload_bq`
lazily via `vk_context().default_bq` at every property access.  Pinning
would break after `vk_reset_device!()`: a `const BACKEND = LavaBackend()`
created at module-load would keep a stale `BatchQueue` tied to the old
`VkDevice`, and every subsequent buffer created via that backend would end
up allocated on the dead device — later triggering
`VUID-vkCmdCopyBuffer-commonparent` and a page-aligned GPUVM fault.
Explicit queues passed to `LavaBackend(bq)` / `LavaBackend(d, u)` are
pinned on purpose (the caller wants those exact queues, e.g. an async
upload queue).

The device a backend or an array belongs to.

The accessor the rest of the stack should reach for instead of calling
`vk_context()` and hoping. `vk_context()` stays as the convenience default for
the single-device case; what has to stop is code *depending* on it, because a
global cannot answer "which device" once there are two.

**No new state.** Both are derived from what these objects already carried:
`BatchQueue.ctx` for a backend and `Buffer.ctx` for an array. That is worth
saying because it was briefly got wrong in the other direction — a `ctx` field
was added to `LavaBackend` on the belief that no path existed, which came from
reading the first half of `BatchQueue`'s field list, where `ctx::Any` sits
sixty-odd lines down. A second copy of a fact the queue already holds can only
ever disagree with it, so this derives instead.

`b.dispatch_bq` resolves through `vk_context()` when the backend is unpinned, so
an unpinned backend answers "whichever device is current" — which is the correct
answer for it, and the reason the queue-only constructors need nothing extra.

"""
    caps(ctx).workgrouplimit :: Int

Largest workgroup Lava will ask the device for — its own
`maxComputeWorkGroupInvocations`. Requesting more throws.

This was a module-level `Ref(1024)` whose docstring said exactly the sentence
above while being a hardcoded constant, and before that it sat at **256** on a
diagnosis that was wrong in an instructive way and is worth keeping written down.

The recorded claim was that "above 256 this driver silently runs fewer
invocations than the shader declares" — a workgroup of 512 wrote half its output,
1024 wrote a quarter, no error anywhere. Everything about it pointed at hardware:
`spirv-val` passed, the SPIR-V declared `LocalSize 512 1 1`, the driver reported
identical Register Count for a body that failed and one that did not, and it was
body-dependent (64 simultaneously live values failed, 32 and 128 did not).

**None of it was the device.** A kernel reading `lava_local_invocation_index()`
with an unconditional store reports every lane running and writing at 256, 384,
512, 768 and 1024. The real cause was one line in `get_compute_pipeline`:

    cache_key = hash((spirv_bytes, ...))

`Base.hash` on a large `Vector` *samples* elements rather than reading all of
them. The 256- and 512-wide modules of one kernel differ at **exactly one byte**
— the `LocalSize` operand — and collide. So the 512 launch looked up the 256
pipeline, dispatched a 256-thread shader over a grid computed for 512, and wrote
`256/wg` of its output. Whichever size compiled first won, which is the whole of
the "order dependence"; whether a given body's two modules happened to collide is
the whole of the "body dependence"; and adding an unrelated store "fixed" it by
changing enough bytes to miss the collision.

See [`spirv_content_hash`](@ref), which reads every byte. `test/test_workgroup_limit.jl`
pins the coverage at every size on both launch spellings, and asserts directly
that two one-byte-different modules no longer share a cache key.

The lesson generalises past workgroups: **any** two SPIR-V modules differing only
in bytes the sampling hash skips shared a pipeline. That is a silent
wrong-results bug for any pair of kernel instantiations that differ in a literal.

See [`DeviceCaps`](@ref), which is where it lives now — the limit differs between
devices, so a process-wide `Ref` answered one device's question for all of them.

`interior_unit_workgroup` cannot see this one: `(16,2,2,2,2,1)` has no interior
unit extent, and its unit extent is *trailing*, which for the earlier fault was
harmless. The written fraction is not a clean function of the block counts (0.5
and 0.062 on shapes differing only in extents), so this pins the trigger and
makes no claim about a law.

Found through `permutedims!`, which returned wrong data for SAM 2's rank-6
window-partition shapes while the ordinary broadcast of the same permutation was
correct — the broadcast uses a linear ndrange and never reaches here.

the same call as the device-array form, with a `Workgroup` pointer instead of a
device address.

Here rather than beside the rest of `AcceleratedMatrix` only because
`device/acceleratedmatrix.jl` is included before this type exists.

Taking the array rather than making callers reach for `.ptr`: that field is an
implementation detail, and a kernel reading `AcceleratedMatrix{...}(tile, 1, 16)`
should say the same thing whether `tile` is shared or global.

The `MemoryLayout` operand for a shared-memory load.

The global-pointer form has taken this since the staged GEMM needed A `RowMajor`
and B `ColumnMajor` out of one block, but the `@localmem` form did not, so a
kernel wanting a row-major operand out of shared memory got a method lookup
failure — which surfaces as `jl_f_throw_methoderror` in the middle of otherwise
valid GPU code rather than as a missing method at the call site.

Attention needs it in both directions. With `q`, `k`, `v` laid out `(E, L, H, B)`
the score product reads Q row-major and Kᵀ column-major from the same staging
stride, and the value product reads P and V both row-major — no transpose
anywhere, which is only available if the layout is a parameter here too.

The layout operand for a shared-memory *store*, the mirror of the load above.

The load has taken a layout since the staged GEMM needed one; the store did not,
which left the pair asymmetric for no reason — the emitter has always written
whichever `MemoryLayout` the intrinsic name carries, for stores as much as loads.

What it is for: the shape a tile is stored in decides how the scalar code that
reads it next can be parallelised. A tile produced with rows down one axis and
reduced along a row wants to be stored row-major, or the row's elements sit a
whole stride apart and land in one shared-memory bank.

`DNNKernels`' attention kernel is where that came up and it does **not** use
this: giving each subgroup a row and each lane a key measured 5% slower than the
thread-per-row loop it replaced, so the score tile went back to column-major.
The operand stays because the asymmetry was a gap rather than a decision, and
because the next kernel to want it should not have to discover that the emitter
was ready all along.
