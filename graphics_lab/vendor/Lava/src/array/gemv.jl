# Matrix-vector multiply. Two kernels, because there are two layouts.
#
# ## The layout decides the kernel, and it is not a detail
#
# A GEMV reads the matrix exactly once, so the only thing that matters is that
# the read coalesces and that there are enough threads in flight to cover the
# latency. Which decomposition achieves that is the *opposite* in the two
# layouts, so this file has two kernels and `gemv!` dispatches on the type:
#
#   * **`gemv_kcontig_kernel`** — matrix `(K, N)`, contiguous along the
#     reduction axis. Ported from llama.cpp's Vulkan backend
#     (`dev/llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-vulkan/vulkan-shaders/mul_mat_vec.comp`,
#     MIT). Threads split `K`, the read coalesces along `K`, and the partial sums
#     come back through `subgroup_add` plus a shared-memory tail.
#
#   * **`gemv_ncontig_kernel`** — matrix `(M, K)`, contiguous along the *output*
#     axis, reached as `gemv!(C, x, transpose(W))`. Here consecutive **outputs**
#     are consecutive addresses, so the coalesced decomposition is one thread per
#     output row and the reduction over `K` happens *inside* a thread. A
#     workgroup still splits `K` across `BLOCK / TM` groups, purely to have
#     enough threads resident — with one thread per row, `M = 1280` is 1280
#     threads, which is 5 workgroups on a 48-core device.
#
# **DNNKernels' graphs produce the second layout, not the first.** `hoistpermutes`
# materialises every weight as torch `(K, N)` — Julia `(N, K)` — because that is
# what `coopmat_gemm!` wants. So the ported llama.cpp kernel, on its own, does not
# apply to the model it was ported for: pointing it at these weights would need a
# 634 MB transpose per model. That is worth stating plainly, because "we ported
# the SOTA kernel" and "the SOTA kernel fits our data" are different claims and
# only the first was true here.
#
# ## What this kernel does NOT fix
#
# Whisper's decoder step went from 13.58 ms to 13.50 ms when these kernels
# replaced `mul!` in it — no change — even though an interleaved same-session A/B
# has them 1.9-3.0x faster on the shapes that step runs. The reason is that the
# step is not GPU-bound:
#
#     a (64, 64) GEMV — 16 KiB — costs   0.0553 ms
#     a (1280, 1280) GEMV — 6.4 MiB —    0.0555 ms
#
# Flat, four hundredfold apart in size. Timing the dispatch loop without waiting
# for the device puts ~89% of that on the host, and a broadcast and a `mul!`
# measure the same, so it is not this code path: **Lava costs ~63 us of host time
# per dispatch**, and the decoder's 96 ops are a 6.1 ms floor under an 11.2 ms
# step. Kernel tuning cannot reach it; `Lava.capture` / `replay!` can, which is
# what it already did for SAM 2's decode.
#
# Recorded here because these kernels look like the fix for the decoder and are
# not — they are the fix for the *arithmetic*, which was the smaller half.
#
# ## Why this is not `mul!`
#
# `coopmat_gemm!` needs `M >= 16` — a cooperative matrix *is* a 16x16 tile — so
# at `M = 1` fifteen sixteenths of every tile is padding. Measured on Whisper's
# decoder shapes, fp32, against the 307 GB/s DRAM roofline this card sustains:
#
#     shape                      mul! ms   GB/s    % of roof
#     (1,1280)@(1280,1280)        0.6146   10.7      3.5%
#     (1,1280)@(1280,5120)        0.5263   49.8     16.2%
#     (1,5120)@(5120,1280)        0.2473  106.0     34.5%
#     (1,1280)@(1280,51866)       2.5908  102.5     33.4%
#
# One Whisper decoder token is ~20.4 ms of that against a 2.07 ms bandwidth
# floor. llama.cpp ships `mul_mat_vec.comp` separately from `mul_mm.comp` for
# exactly this reason: batch-1 decode is a different kernel, not a tuning of the
# same one.
#
# ## The structure that was ported
#
# **`NROWS` output columns per workgroup.** This is the whole trick and it is not
# obvious: a GEMV reads `K*N` matrix elements and only `K` vector elements, so it
# is hopelessly bandwidth-bound *unless* the vector read is amortised. Handling
# several output columns per workgroup reads the vector slice once into registers
# and reuses it `NROWS` times. llama.cpp's `NUM_ROWS`.
#
# **Four elements of K per thread per step** (`K_PER_ITER = 4` there for the
# non-quantised types). Wide enough for the loads to coalesce, narrow enough that
# `NROWS` accumulators still fit in registers.
#
# **Reduce with `subgroup_add`, then across subgroups through shared memory** —
# `reduce_result` in `mul_mat_vec_base.glsl`. The comment there is worth keeping:
# the subgroup path wins *particularly when the workgroup has more than one
# subgroup*, because it collapses a log2(BLOCK) shared-memory tree into one
# instruction plus a log2(nsubgroups) tail.
#
# Not ported: the quantised paths (`dequantize4`, `QUANT_K`/`QUANT_R`) — we have
# no quantised weights — and the 4/2/1 manual unroll ladder, which exists to
# handle `ncols` not dividing the block. Ours takes a bounds check on the tail;
# whether the ladder pays here is a measurement nobody has made.
#
# Constants are NOT llama.cpp's. Per `feedback-port-sota-kernels` the structure
# ports and every number is re-measured — see `gemv_config`.
#
# ## Why this is `@eval`-generated
#
# The first version wrote the accumulators as an `NTuple` rebound inside the
# `K` loop. That does not compile: the tuple is a mutable local captured by the
# `ntuple` closure, so it boxes, and the failure arrives as thirty lines of
# `unsupported dynamic function invocation` naming `ntuple`, `to_indices` and
# `_typeof_captured_variable` — nowhere near the cause. The same trap the
# mixed-radix FFT hit.
#
# With `NROWS`/`BLOCK` fixed at generation time the accumulators are plain
# scalars from `Base.Cartesian.@nexprs`, every index is a literal, and there is
# no closure anywhere.

`C[m] = epilogue(bias[m] + sum_k W[m, k] * x[k])` for `W` stored `(M, K)`, i.e.
contiguous along `m`.

**One thread per output row.** `W[m, k]` for consecutive `m` and fixed `k` are
consecutive addresses, so a warp covering `TM = 32` rows reads one full 128-byte
transaction per step. That is the whole reason this kernel is shaped the way it
is, and it is why the reduction is *not* a subgroup reduction: the values a
subgroup holds belong to 32 different outputs, and adding them would be adding
unrelated numbers.

**`BLOCK / TM` threads per row, to have any threads at all.** One thread per
output on a `(1280, 1280)` weight is 1280 threads — 5 workgroups on a device with
48 shader cores, so the kernel would be latency-bound at a few percent of
bandwidth no matter how well it coalesced. That is exactly the failure `mul!`
shows on this shape (3.5% of roofline). Splitting `K` across `BLOCK / TM` groups
and reducing through shared memory brings `M = 1280` to 40 workgroups.

`UNROLL` accumulators, because the `K` loop is otherwise a single dependency
chain of `K / (BLOCK / TM)` fused multiply-adds — 160 of them at the shapes here,
each waiting on the last.

**The cross-group reduction is a tree, and that is what makes a large `BLOCK`
usable.** Summing the `BLOCK / TM` partials serially in the `kg == 0` threads
costs `BLOCK / TM` dependent adds performed by `TM` threads while the other
`BLOCK - TM` sit idle — so raising `BLOCK` to get occupancy paid for itself with
a longer tail, and `(5120, 1280)` measured *fastest* at `BLOCK = 128` for exactly
that reason. The tree is `log2(BLOCK / TM)` steps with every thread working, so
the tail stops growing with `BLOCK`.

Bias and epilogue are folded into the store for the same reason the GEMM folds
them: the alternative is a second kernel that reads and writes `M` elements to
add one number to each.

    GEMV_PREGENERATED_LIMITS

Workgroup-size limits to pre-generate GEMV kernels for, at Lava load.

Both GEMV families are `@eval`-generated (see the two "Why this is
`@eval`-generated" notes above), and **an `@eval` on the runtime path cannot be
precompiled**: a downstream package whose `@compile_workload` reaches one dies
with

    Evaluation into the closed module `Lava` breaks incremental compilation

so the workload silently skips and every first call in a fresh process pays the
compile the Runner packages exist to remove. That is not hypothetical and it is
not new — `FFT_PREGENERATED` exists for exactly this, found by `KokoroRunner`.
The GEMV port reintroduced it, and `SAM2Runner` is where it showed up: its
workload skipped with that message, so nothing SAM 2 runs was frozen.

Generating at load moves the `@eval` to ordinary top-level code. The set is small
and derived — the loop below asks `gemv_config` and `gemv_ncontig_config`
themselves rather than restating their answers, so a change to either is followed
automatically. `(1, 4096)` are the two sides of every branch those functions take.

The limit is a *device* property and there is no device at load time, so the
plausible values are enumerated instead. A device outside this list still works;
it merely pays the old cost, which is the same failure mode as before and not a
worse one.
