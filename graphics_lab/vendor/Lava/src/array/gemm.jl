# `mul!` for LavaArray.
#
# How a matrix multiply is performed on this device is Lava's business, not its
# caller's. `mul!` picks from the operand types and the device's reported
# capabilities; nothing above this layer needs to know that tensor cores exist.
# There are three kernels, in descending order of preference:
#
#   * `coopmat_gemm!`, staged cooperative matrices. fp16 operands into an fp32
#     destination on extents that land on the 16-wide tile.
#   * `scalar_gemm_staged_kernel!`, staged and register-blocked but with ordinary
#     `muladd`. The fp32 path, and the fp16 path wherever the tile does not fit
#     or the device has no cooperative matrices at all.
#   * `strided_gemm_kernel!`, one invocation per output element. What is left for
#     fp64 and complex, and for products too small or too ragged to tile.
#
# The first two are ports of the two `#ifdef COOPMAT` branches of the same
# shader, llama.cpp's `mul_mm.comp`, vendored at `reference/mul_mm/`.
#
# Measured on an RTX 4000 Ada, 2048³, fp16 in / fp32 accumulate:
#   scalar kernel                            ~0.7 TFLOP/s
#   coopmat, one 16×16 tile per subgroup      0.79
#   coopmat, 4×4 register block              ~6.0
#   coopmat, 4×4 block + 2 subgroups/group   ~22
# Both jumps are about feeding the units, not the units themselves: the 4×4
# block makes four A-loads and four B-loads serve sixteen `muladd`s, and a
# second subgroup per workgroup gives the scheduler something to overlap the
# remaining global loads against. 4×4 is a real optimum — 4×8 and 8×4 fall to
# ~3 TFLOP/s and 8×8 to ~1.75, which is register spilling.

# The kernel above loads every cooperative matrix straight from global memory,
# so with a 4×4 register block each A tile is read four times and each B tile
# four times per k-step, and both subgroups repeat the same B loads. Every
# high-performance implementation instead stages a block of A and a block of B
# into workgroup memory once and loads the matrices from there — llama.cpp's
# Vulkan backend (`ggml-vulkan/vulkan-shaders/mul_mm.comp`, MIT) does exactly
# that, and so does cuBLAS, which reaches 44.6 TFLOP/s on these shapes.
#
# **The first port of it was a wash, and the reason was measurable.** With
# `VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties` the driver reports, per pipeline,
# registers and workgroup memory — and workgroup memory is where NVIDIA puts a
# cooperative matrix it cannot keep in registers:
#
#                       registers   shared/WG   of which ours
#   direct 4×4 block      255 (cap)     25344         0

#
# The direct kernel spills its entire 4×4 accumulator block — it declares no
# `@localmem` at all and the driver still gives it 25 KB — and the staged 4×4,
# which is exactly `mul_mm.comp`'s shipped configuration, spills 31 KB on top of
# its blocks and lands at 4.6 TFLOP/s. Neither is a tiling problem. Both are one
# structural difference from the reference: the first port held `ST` A-fragments
# **and** `ST` B-fragments live across a 2-way k-unroll, sixteen fragments at
# ST=4, where `mul_mm.comp` keeps exactly one of each and reloads B inside the
# innermost loop. Sixteen 16×16 fp16 fragments is 64 registers on top of the
# accumulator block's 128, and 255 is the cap.

A staged-GEMM tiling: `(STM, STN, WM, WN, BK, PAD)`.

The three levels of `mul_mm.comp`'s block -> warp -> tile, as parameters rather
than as constants, because which one wins is a property of the device and not of
the algorithm — and because the previous version hardcoded its `@nexprs` counts
to the value it shipped with, so the "4 measured worse" recorded beside the
constant had never actually run a 4×4 warp tile.

  * `WM × WN` subgroups per workgroup, arranged with `WM` down the M axis;
  * each subgroup owns `STM × STN` cooperative-matrix tiles;
  * so the workgroup covers `BM = 16*STM*WM` by `BN = 16*STN*WN` of C, walking K
    in steps of `BK`, and its shared blocks carry `PAD` elements of
    leading-dimension padding against bank conflicts.

Arithmetic intensity is what the warp tile buys: per k-step a workgroup stages
`(BM + BN) * BK` elements and does `BM * BN * BK * 2` flops, so widening the
*warp* tile raises the ratio without touching the staging cost at all — provided
the accumulators still fit in registers, which is the whole difficulty.

shared-store address goes through a real division by a non-power-of-two constant
*loses stores* on this driver once the loop is unrollable and a cooperative-matrix
`muladd` is in scope: at `BM = 96`, 2184 of 3072 slots end up holding another

    GEMM_TILINGS

The tilings a kernel is generated for, **fastest first** — `gemm_tiling` takes
the first whose block divides the shape, so the order is the preference and the
last entries exist for coverage rather than for speed.

One compiled `@kernel` per entry, so the list is short on purpose. Measured on an
RTX 4000 Ada over SAM 2's six `addmm` shapes, weighted by their share of the
encoder's GEMM arithmetic, against the register-blocked kernel's 20.5:

     64 x 128, 8 warps   28.3      <- shipped default
     64 x  64, 4 warps   26.1
    128 x  64, 8 warps   22.3
     32 x 128, 8 warps   19.8      but 20.7 against 13.9 on the one shape that
                                      only it divides

**Widening the warp grid wins; widening the warp tile loses.** A 2x4 warp *tile*
(same block, 4 warps) runs at 7.3 and `mul_mm.comp`'s own 4x4 at 5.9, because a
16x16 fp32 accumulator is 8 registers per lane and sixteen of them do not fit —
the driver spills them into workgroup memory, 31 KB of it. This kernel wants
warps in flight, not work per warp, which is the opposite of what the reference
is tuned for and is worth re-measuring on any other device.

Every entry is checked by `test_gemm_staged.jl` at ten values of K, and that is
not a formality: 96 x 128 silently lost 4 of every 32 k-terms per row until the
staging index stopped going through a real division. See `splitidx` and
`test_shared_index_division.jl`.

**The 28.3-vs-27.x ordering above was an artefact of averaging.** 96 x 128 is the
faster kernel on four of SAM 2's six shapes, by 8.6% to 21.0%; it loses only on
`576 x 4096 x 2304`, and it loses there by 18.3%, which is enough to take the
weighted mean with it because that shape is 24.4% of the arithmetic. Swept over K
with everything else fixed, the loss is not a trend but a wall — see
`gemm_aliasing`. Per-shape, the mean was hiding the opposite conclusion.

crossover: at the bad K its throughput pins at 30-33 TFLOP/s no matter how large
K grows, while the 64-row block scales normally past 40.

`A` is `M x K`, so its row stride is `2K` bytes and a `K` divisible by 256 makes
that a multiple of 512 — the classic power-of-two-stride aliasing shape, where
the rows of a staged tile collide in a few cache sets. That is the suspected
mechanism and it is *not* confirmed: both blocks are register-limited to two
workgroups per SM (120 and 128 registers, neither spilling, measured through
`VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties`), so it is not occupancy, and the 96-row
block reads less global memory than the 64-row one, so it is not traffic either.
Pinning it further needs Nsight.

Keyed on the block not being a power of two rather than on the literal 96,
because that is the property the suspected mechanism turns on. The generalisation
is untested for other non-power-of-two blocks — but it can only ever *decline* a

suggests, because that table compares tilings and this compares kernels. Reaching
it via padding costs a `padcols` pass over `B` and a destination wider than the
caller's.

**25% is nonetheless the bar, and deliberately conservative**, because those
ratios were measured at `N = 1500` and the shapes this rule can *hurt* are the
small ones, where a workgroup grid of a few tiles is launch-bound rather than
throughput-bound and the staged kernel's advantage has not been measured at all.
`N = 48` would pad to 64 and `N = 8` to 64 — 1.33x and 8x the work, for an

A caller that pads `N` itself (`mm_coopmat_plan` pads the token axis, an im2col
matrix is built to size) has to choose *what* to pad to, and rounding to the
16-wide cooperative-matrix tile is the wrong answer: `gemm_tiling` needs the
whole 64- or 128-wide **block** to divide, so a 16-multiple that is not also a
block multiple lands on the register-blocked kernel instead of the staged one.

Whisper's encoder is the case that makes this concrete. Every one of its 160
matmuls has 1500 tokens, `cld(1500, 16) * 16` is 1504, and 1504 is not a
multiple of 64 or 128 — so all 160 missed the staged kernel by 32 columns.

# That reads as redundant work and is the opposite: a 16×16 fp16 fragment is four
# registers per lane, so hoisting `STM` A-fragments and `STN` B-fragments out of
# the loop — which is what the first port did, across a 2-way k-unroll on top —
# costs 64 registers at 4×4 against an accumulator block that already wants 128.
# The driver then spills the accumulators into workgroup memory (31 KB of it,
# reported by `VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties`) and the kernel runs at a
# quarter speed. Shared memory is fast; reloading from it is the cheap side of
# that trade, and it is why the reference can afford a 4×4 warp tile at all.
#
# Both staging loops are written so that consecutive lanes read consecutive
# *global* addresses — `i` fastest for A, `k` fastest for B — because that is the
# side where coalescing matters. The shared side is strided and does not care.
#
# A comment rather than a docstring because the kernels are generated in the
# `@eval` loop below and there is no single definition for it to attach to.

# ── wide staging loads: tried, measured, removed ─────────────────────────────
#
# `mul_mm.comp` stages its A and B blocks with wide loads (`LOAD_VEC_A_EFF`) —
# the last structural difference between its inner loop and ours. Both of our
# blocks are contiguous on the axis a lane walks and every offset is a multiple
# of 4 by construction, so it ports directly: `unsafe_load` through a
# `Ptr{NTuple{4,Float16}}` works on this backend and is bit-exact.
#
# **It loses, at every width.** Against the register-blocked kernel on the four
# dominant shapes:
#
#   scalar   1.04 - 1.09x
#   2-wide   0.80 - 0.92x
#   4-wide   0.69 - 0.81x
#
# The global side is not the problem — it is coalesced either way. The shared
# side is: `@localmem` here is `Float16`, so a lane that loaded `V` elements
# writes them with `V` scalar stores whose addresses stride by `V` across the
# warp. At V=2 that is a 2-way bank conflict on every store and at V=4 a 4-way,
# against none at all for the stride-1 scalar loop. The monotonic 1 > 2 > 4
# ordering is the conflict count, not noise.
#
# The reference does not hit this because it widens the *shared array* at the
# same time — `FLOAT_TYPEV2 buf_a[]`, with `SHMEM_STRIDE` counted in `vec2`.
#
# **That capability now exists**; this kernel simply does not use it yet. Two
# pieces were missing and both are in, with a device test in
# `test_coopmat_shared.jl`:
#
#   * `@localmem NTuple{2,VecElement{Float16}}` — `Op.OpCompositeInsert` was used
#     by the emitter and never declared, so building a vector value element by
#     element died with `UndefVarError` rather than compiling;
#   * `loadw2`, a cooperative-matrix load whose access chain addresses the vector
#     rather than the scalar component. `OpCooperativeMatrixLoadKHR` permits a
#     vector pointee whose component type matches the matrix and counts `Stride`
#     in those vectors.
#
# What remains is the integration, and it is mechanical: declare `sA`/`sB` as
# vec2 arrays, halve `LDA`/`LDB` and the coopmat strides, and have each lane
# store one packed pair instead of two halves — `AREPS`/`BREPS` halve with it.
# A is packed along `m` and B along `k`, which is the contiguous axis on each, so
# both stay coalesced on the global side and neither needs a transpose. The
# `test_gemm_staged.jl` K-sweep is what should catch it if the index maths slips.

const GEMM_STAGED_KERNELS = Dict{GemmTiling,Any}()

"""
`vec2`-typed staging buffers, the shape `mul_mm.comp` uses.

Every shared access becomes 32 bits instead of 16: the staging store writes one
packed pair per lane, and the cooperative-matrix load addresses the vector with
its stride counted in vectors. A packs along `m` and B along `k` — the contiguous
axis on each — so both stay coalesced globally and neither needs a transpose.

**On, and worth 1.09x.** Measured interleaved over SAM 2's six `addmm` shapes,
weighted by their share of the encoder's GEMM arithmetic:

    register-blocked   21.0 TFLOP/s
    scalar staging     32.3
    vec2 staging       35.3      <- 1.09x over scalar, 1.68x over register-blocked

which is **79% of cuBLAS's 44.6**, from 70%. The gain is largest exactly where
staging is largest relative to arithmetic: the 288-row shape, which needs the
32 x 128 tiling, goes 18.7 -> 28.3, a 1.51x.

A `Ref` because the only measurement worth having is the scalar and vec2 kernels
interleaved in one session on one set of buffers. Both are generated; this picks
which runs. A tiling with no vec2 twin falls back to its scalar kernel.

"""
Narrow-index twins of `GEMM_STAGED_V2_KERNELS`: the ones `coopmat_gemm!`'s
`narrow_ok` selects, which compute the staging addresses in `Int32` instead of
`Int`.

Julia hands out `Int64` indices and Lava emits them as-is, but NVIDIA has no
64-bit integer unit: adds and multiplies are emulated. The same narrowing was
worth **1.56x** in `im2col_kernel!`, which is why it was tried here.

It does **not** work the way that suggests. The register count goes *up*
(118 -> 124) and the occupancy is unchanged at 2 workgroups an SM, so whatever it
buys is instruction count in the staging loop, not residency. Measured
interleaved in one session, both orders, over SAM 2's eight `addmm` shapes
weighted by call count: **-1.2%**, from -4.9% to +0.9%, results bit-identical.

The gap between that and the 3.5-9% a *cross-session* comparison first showed is
the reason the rule exists — the earlier baseline was a different process on a
differently-warmed card, and it inflated the effect by 4x.

Kept anyway: it is free and never wrong. Both kernels exist because the narrow
one is only *legal* while `M*K`, `K*N` and `M*N` fit in an `Int32`
(`gemm_fits32`), and the wide one is the fallback for anything larger, so the
duplication is a correctness requirement and not only a measurement convenience.

    gemmaccum(T) -> Type

What a GEMM reduces in, given its destination type. `Float16` widens to `Float32`
and everything else keeps its own type.

This is `DNNKernels`' `accum` under a local name, and it exists because the
per-element kernel used to reduce in `eltype(C)`: an fp16 destination summed the
whole K loop in fp16. Measured on MatAnyone, 29 of its 132 `matmul!` calls land
there with K between 256 and 769, which costs 12x to 20x the error of reducing in
fp32 and storing once — in a model verified to 2.8e-4.

The obvious alternative was to stop those calls declining the cooperative-matrix
path at all: 27 of the 29 decline only because an operand is a
`PermutedDimsArray`. Materialising it to qualify measured **slower** (0.876x and
0.978x on MatAnyone over two rounds), because 18 of the 27 have `N = 16` and the
copy costs more than the tensor cores return. Hence widening here instead.

# The per-element kernel. No longer the general fp32 path: `staged_gemm_ok`
# routes anything Float32 and big enough to tile to `scalar_gemm_staged_kernel!`
# below, which is 9.6x faster at 2048^3. What is left here is what that one
# cannot take, and each case is a real one rather than a leftover:
#
#   * fp64 and complex, whose accumulators do not fit the staged kernel's
#     Float32 shared blocks;
#   * products too small to fill the device with `BM x BN` tiles, where this
#     kernel's much larger grid genuinely wins;
#   * products so far off the tile grid that a staged launch would compute
#     mostly-discarded output, a vector destination being the extreme.
#
# It takes each operand as a *dense base array plus strides* rather than as the
# wrapper the caller had. A transposed operand is then just a pair of swapped
# strides — no copy, no second kernel, and no wrapper type inside the kernel at
# all. That last part matters: `@Const` runs `Adapt.adapt_structure` on the
# device, and rebuilding a wrapper there drags its constructor's error paths in
# with it (see the PermutedDimsArray quirk). The staged kernel takes its operands
# the same way for the same reason.
#
# `K` is passed rather than read from `axes(A, 2)` for the same reason — the host
# knows the extent, so the kernel need not query anything.

# `gemmaccum` above is the accumulator width this kernel uses; it was found twice,
# independently, from opposite ends. The table there is the arithmetic; the other
# half of the evidence is the model: Whisper's `fc2` at K = 5120 measured 4.83e-2
# against an fp64 reference where the fixed path reads 2.13e-4 — 234x, and
# `sqrt(K) * eps(Float16) / 2` predicts 3.49e-2, which is what makes it a
# diagnosis rather than a correlation. It reaches the scalar kernel at all
# because `mm_coopmat_plan` declines whenever an operand arrives wrapped, which
# in a RAW exported graph is every `addmm` — `Model` rewrites those away, so this
# is the path `verifygraph` runs and not the one inference does.

        # `DNNKernels`' own `mm2` gets this right (`T = accum(eltype(A))`, i.e.

        # accumulator from the destination. `attn_scores`, `attn_apply`,

        # How much it costs. Compare against the right baseline: the alternative
        # is not an fp32 result, it is `mm3`'s fp32 ACCUMULATION rounded to an
        # fp16 store, so fp16 output rounding (~3e-4, eps(Float16)/2) is a floor
        # neither path beats. Both reductions run over identical fp16 operands
        # against a Float64 reference; this is arithmetic, so it was measured on
        # the host and holds wherever it runs.

# output element, K walked in global memory, two global loads per `muladd`. At
# 2048^3 on a Radeon 8060S that is **0.448 TFLOP/s** against 14.6 for the fp16
# cooperative-matrix path, and it gets *worse* with size (0.531 at 1024^3), which
# is what a kernel whose working set outgrows cache does.
#
# There is no fp32 shortcut to reach for instead. The driver reports 14
# cooperative-matrix shapes and `FLOAT32` is in none of them as an A or B type,
# only as an accumulator, which matches AMD's documented RDNA3 WMMA input set of
# f16/bf16/iu8/iu4. Splitting fp32 into fp16 terms (the 3xTF32 approach) needs
# three terms and so ~6 products, i.e. ~2.4 TFLOP/s from a 14.6 path, which is
# *below* what this kernel does. A tiled scalar GEMM is the answer, not a
# workaround for a missing one.

# Ported from the `#else` (non-`COOPMAT`) branch of `mul_mm.comp`, vendored at
# `reference/mul_mm/` with its provenance. That is the same shader Lava's
# cooperative-matrix GEMM came from, and the two branches share their staging, so
# this is the other half of a port rather than a new kernel. Measured here:
#
#              Lava naive   this   fp16 coopmat
#     1024^3        0.533   3.067         9.654       (5.8x)
#     2048^3        0.447   5.432        14.577      (12.1x, 37% of the fp16 path)
#
# fp16 is 37% away and not reachable from here: there is no fp32 cooperative
# matrix on this hardware to close it with, only a wider vector kernel.
#
# Two deviations from the reference, stated rather than silent:
#
#   * LAYOUT. ggml holds A row-major over (m, k); a `LavaArray` is column-major,
#     and this kernel takes arbitrary `gemmstrides` besides. The *shared* layout
#     is the reference's (`bufa[m * SHF + k]`); what changes is which index runs
#     fastest in the staging loop, chosen so consecutive lanes still walk
#     consecutive global addresses in the common unit-row-stride case.
#   * NO V2 ACCUMULATOR PACKING. The reference keeps `sums` as `ACC_TYPEV2`,
#     indexing `.x`/`.y` for two adjacent output rows through a flattened
#     `sums_idx`. That is a GLSL vector-type artifact — its shared loads and
#     `dot_product` are vector-typed and a flat array is the only way to index a
#     register block there. Here each accumulator is named by its four `@nexprs`
#     indices: same arithmetic, same register count, same store order.
#
# `WARP` is a tiling parameter, NOT a subgroup requirement: this branch uses no
# subgroup operation, only an index decomposition, so the value need not match
# the device's subgroup width and no capability query gates it.

# ── the one place this departs from the reference's shipped numbers ──────────
#
# `mul_mm.comp` ships `WMITER = 2, TM = 4, TN = 2`; this is `2, 2, 2`. That is not
# a divergence from the algorithm, it is a different point in the parameter space
# the reference itself exposes: these are `layout (constant_id = ...)` spec
# constants precisely because llama.cpp tunes them per device, and its defaults

    # arguments this measured 2.703 TFLOP/s at 2048^3 and 4.895 with them folded

A fresh allocation per multiply is not merely wasteful here: the array is
dropped as soon as `coopmat_gemm!` returns while the dispatches reading it are
still queued, and once the pool starts reclaiming blocks under that churn the
result is `sync_access!: buffer is not ALIVE`. One buffer that only ever grows
avoids both. Callers that already own scratch (the convolution's `Workspace`)
pass `partials` and never touch this.

`C` rather than a bare size, because the buffer has to come from the device the
GEMM will run on and only the destination knows which that is — and it is stored
on that device's `caches`, since a buffer handed to the wrong device is the
defect the memory pool had.

"""
Can this product use the staged kernel rather than the per-element one?

Two independent requirements, and both are about correctness or waste rather
than taste:

  * **dtype.** The staged kernel's shared blocks are `Float32` and it accumulates
    in `eltype(C)`, so it is exactly a `Float32` (or `Float16`-in) kernel. A
    `Float64` or complex product would silently round through `Float32`, so those
    keep the per-element kernel, which accumulates in `eltype(C)` throughout.
  * **shape**, in two ways. One workgroup owns one `BM x BN` tile, so the tile
    count is how many workgroups the launch has to fill the device with; below
    `SGEMM_MINTILES` it cannot, and the per-element kernel's much larger grid
    wins despite doing more work per output. But a tile is also computed *whole*
    whether or not the product fills it, so a shape far off the tile grid pays
    for output it discards. `mul!(::LavaArray{T,1}, ...)` arrives here as `N = 1`
    and is the extreme: at `M = 2048` that is 32 tiles, enough to pass the count,
    while computing a 64-wide column for one useful column. `SGEMM_MAXWASTE`
    bounds the padded area against the real one.
