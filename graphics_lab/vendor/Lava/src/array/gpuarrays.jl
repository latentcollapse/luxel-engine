# ── Adapt.jl integration ──

# LavaAdaptor struct is declared in array/lavaarray.jl (needed earlier by
# ka_backend.jl method signatures).  This file defines the Adapt rules.
#
# The adaptor is the single place LavaArray → LavaDeviceArray (pointer strip)
# happens during kernel-arg conversion, so it is also the single place buffer-
# lifetime pinning fires.  Adapt.jl's recursion handles wrapper structs,
# Broadcasted, NamedTuple — every LavaArray anywhere inside lands here.

    adapt_storage(::LavaAdaptor, ::LavaArray) → LavaDeviceArray

Pure strip: wrap the GPU buffer address in a device-visible struct. **No pin
side effect**. Callers must separately invoke `pin_leaves!(batch, args...)`
before submitting a command buffer that uses the stripped result — otherwise
the underlying `VkManagedBuffer` can be GC'd before the GPU reads from it.

(AMDGPU's adapt is also pure; they get away without an explicit pin pass
because `@roc` uses `GC.@preserve vars...` lexically around a synchronous
dispatch. Lava's dispatches are batched and submitted later, so `@preserve`
isn't enough — hence the explicit `pin_leaves!` step.)

# ── broadcast: always launch over a flat index space ──
#
# GPUArrays' `_copyto!` launches with `ndrange = size(dest)`, so an N-D
# destination gets an N-D index space and KernelAbstractions partitions it into
# N-D workgroups — at which point consecutive lanes no longer walk consecutive
# memory. The cost is not subtle. `D .= A .+ B` over 16.7M Float16:
#
#   dest 1-D          315 GB/s     (CUDA.jl: 325)
#   dest (512,512,64)  54 GB/s     (CUDA.jl: 204)
#
# Same kernel, same data, same card — only the launch geometry differs. CUDA.jl
# never sees this because it overrides broadcast with its own flat grid-stride
# loop rather than going through the KA path.
#
# So: flatten the range, and recover the Cartesian index inside the kernel when
# the broadcast genuinely needs one. That div/mod chain is far cheaper than
# losing coalescing. This is the single largest thing in Lava for anything
# elementwise — `add`, `relu`, `sigmoid`, `_to_copy`, `cat` and every kernel
# epilogue in DNNKernels were all running at a quarter of the achievable bandwidth.
# Each thread handles `U` elements, `WG` apart, which is `contig_copy.comp`'s
# shape from `reference/llama.cpp-vulkan` (128 threads x 4, "num_threads *
# num_iter must equal 512"). The stride is what keeps it coalesced: iteration `u`
# has the whole workgroup on one contiguous run, so all `U` runs are wide loads,
# not a per-thread gather of `U` neighbours.
#
# It buys memory-level parallelism, not fewer instructions — one thread with 8
# loads in flight hides latency a thread with 1 cannot. Measured on the encoder's
# permuted copies (interleaved, 2265 MHz, bit-exact), against the same kernel at
# one element per thread:

    broadcastlaunch(n; wg, maxunroll, mingroups) -> (workgroupsize, Val(U), ndrange)

Launch geometry for a flat broadcast over `n` elements.

`maxunroll` is elements per thread; 1 restores one-element-per-thread. It was a
module-level `Ref` so it could be flipped **inside one session**, because that is
the only comparison this project accepts: an isolated benchmark showed 5-11% here
and a dispatch-timing profile showed the elementwise bucket dropping 18 ms, while
the free-running encode did not move at all across sessions. An argument does
that without making the setting process-wide. Each new value recompiles the
broadcast kernels, so warm up after each flip before timing.

`U` is backed off while the grid would be too small to occupy the device — 8
elements per thread over a 4096-element array is 2 workgroups, and a kernel that
cannot fill the card is slow however well it reads memory. `mingroups` is a few
per SM (48 here), so the back-off only triggers on arrays small enough that the
whole launch is noise anyway.

`ndrange` is rounded up to a whole number of workgroups; the kernels bound every
access with `n` themselves, so the tail threads simply do nothing.

# GPUArrays' generic kernel pays per element disappear. The premise was that the
# permute is bound by that division chain.
#
# **It is not, and removing the divisions made it slower.** Measured against the
# ordinary broadcast — which pays the full `cart32` chain *and* re-indexes a
# `PermutedDimsArray` — the division-free kernel lost by 2.6-5.9x on every shape
# SAM 2's encoder runs (table in `lavapermutedims!` below). What it bought in
# arithmetic it gave back many times over in geometry: an N-D ndrange gets an N-D
# workgroup, consecutive lanes stop walking consecutive memory, and that is the
# same effect the note at the top of this file measures at 54 GB/s against 315.
#
# Access order is the cost. Anything that beats the broadcast has to change the
# order — tile it, or widen what one workgroup covers — and it belongs in the
# broadcast path so both spellings get it.

"""
    launchgroup(sz, target = 256) -> Dims

Workgroup shape for an `ndrange` of `sz`: fill from the fastest axis up, moving
to the next only once the current one is exhausted.

Filling in axis order is what makes the group a *contiguous* run of memory —
every axis before the first partially-taken one is complete, so `(4, 4, 288,
1024)` yields `(4, 4, 16, 1)`, covering 256 consecutive elements. Left to
KernelAbstractions, which derives the group from the ndrange alone, that same
shape launches with a **4-thread** workgroup: 4 of 32 lanes in the warp doing
work.

**Pass the result as a launch keyword**, `kernel(backend)(args...; ndrange,
workgroupsize = launchgroup(ndrange))`, and *not* as `kernel(backend, wg)`.
Those two spellings are not equivalent:

  * `kernel(backend, wg)` puts the size in the kernel's type, so the iteration
    space it builds pairs a `blocks` field with a zero-size `workitems::Nothing`.
    For a **rank-4** ndrange that combination computes wrong global indices —
    `ndrange = (72, 256, 8, 16)`, `wg = (32, 4, 1, 1)` writes 294 912 of
    2 359 296 elements and reports no error. Ranks 1-3 and rank 5 are fine, as
    is `kernel(backend, wg, ndrange)` with both static, which is what makes the
    fault easy to miss.
  * The keyword form keeps both extents as fields and is correct at every rank
    tested. `test_static_workgroup.jl` pins the difference.

    staticgroup(sz, target = 256) -> Dims

Like [`launchgroup`](@ref) but never returns an interior unit extent, so the
result can go in the kernel's TYPE without tripping `WORKGROUP_FALLBACK` — which
keeps the index arithmetic compile-time constant.

Each interior axis is given 2 first (or its own extent, if smaller), and whatever
is left of the budget goes to the fastest axis. That trades some of `launchgroup`'s
contiguity for the constant-folded indexing; only worth it where measured.

**Only as far as the budget reaches.** Two threads on every interior axis is
`2^(N-2)` threads, which passes `target` at rank 10 and is 65 536 at rank 18 —
past `maxComputeWorkGroupInvocations` on every device, so the dispatch simply
never completes. GPUArrays' 18-d `permutedims` test hung there for the full
120 s flush timeout and took the following 354 assertions of the suite with it.
Above that rank the reservation stops and the trailing axes stay at 1, which is
exactly what `WORKGROUP_FALLBACK` exists to catch: the launch is re-issued
dynamically and is correct, just without the constant-folded indices.
