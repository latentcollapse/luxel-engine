stack, not an error anyone can act on. Every entry point that touches the handle
checks first.

still a perfectly good window to draw to, and the loop condition is what decides

Rebuild the swapchain if the window no longer matches it, and say whether it did.

A resize is not reliably reported: `OUT_OF_DATE` is what a driver *may* return and
`SUBOPTIMAL` is a success code that never reaches an error branch. On Xwayland
neither arrives — the window changes size and the swapchain keeps presenting at
the old one, which the compositor scales. Comparing the framebuffer size against
what the swapchain was built for is what notices.

Separate from `acquire_next_image!` so a caller that has to know the size *before*
it starts recording — a graph, whose other attachments have to cover the render
area — can bring the swapchain up to date first and bail out without a half
recorded frame. Zero is a minimised window and has no swapchain to build.
