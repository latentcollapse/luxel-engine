# LLVM pass: CFG structurization for Vulkan SPIR-V compliance.
#
# Ported from Abacus compilation.jl (fixup_structured_cfg!, isolate_shared_merge_targets!,
# insert_cfg_trampoline!).
#
# Vulkan requires structured control flow (no irreducible loops, single-entry/single-exit
# regions). Complex Julia code (CartesianIndices, bounds checking, error paths) generates
# CFGs that violate this. The standard LLVM pass sequence handles most cases:
#   LowerSwitch -> UnifyFunctionExitNodes -> FixIrreducible -> StructurizeCFG
#
# However, StructurizeCFG needs pre-processing: when a block is the target of multiple
# conditional branches from different nesting levels, StructurizeCFG can produce wrong
# back-edge conditions (loop exits after 1 iteration). This pass inserts trampoline blocks
# to give each construct its own unique merge target, analogous to clspv's
# FixupStructuredCFGPass / isolateContinue().
#
# Pass pipeline order (assembled in compilation.jl):
#   SimplifyCFG -> fixup_structured_cfg! -> LowerSwitch -> UnifyFunctionExitNodes
#   -> FixIrreducible -> StructurizeCFG -> InstCombine

"""
    fixup_structured_cfg!(mod::LLVM.Module)

Pre-StructurizeCFG fixup pass, analogous to clspv's `FixupStructuredCFGPass`.

Detects blocks that are the successor of multiple conditional branches from different
nesting levels and inserts trampoline blocks so each construct gets its own unique
merge target. Without this, StructurizeCFG can produce incorrect back-edge conditions
causing loops to exit after a single iteration.

    merge_equivalent_loop_phis!(mod::LLVM.Module)

Merge phi nodes in the same block that have identical incoming value/predecessor
pairs. StructurizeCFGPass frequently duplicates loop-carried phis (e.g., hits
accumulator, induction variable) when a loop contains a `continue` statement
that creates an "early" back-edge bypassing the loop tail. The duplicates trace
the same underlying value but reach the header via different intermediate
phi/block chains, and LLVM's own value-numbering doesn't eliminate them because
the chains themselves look structurally distinct.

This pass runs a GVN-style fixed-point merge: two phis in the same block are
treated as equivalent if, for every predecessor edge, their operands are either
the same LLVM value or already proven equivalent in a previous round. Merging
collapses both phi SSA names to a single value, which prevents SPIR-V emission
from producing two loop-header phis that pick up the increment on different
back-edges — the source of the walk-with-`continue` miscompile.

    replace_undef_phi_operands_with_constants!(mod::LLVM.Module)

For every phi node, replace `undef` / `poison` operands of scalar integer/float
types with LLVM constants (int 0, float 0.0, bool false). Applies after
StructurizeCFG, which inserts `undef` as the "don't-care" value on predecessors
that reach the phi via guard-controlled paths that are semantically never taken.

Why: SPIR-V's OpUndef "may yield a different bit pattern per consumption"
(RADV interprets this literally), which breaks the guard phis StructurizeCFG
relies on — the guard bool becomes non-deterministic and the "unreachable" undef
path executes for real, feeding garbage to downstream uses. Deterministic zero
constants dominate all predecessors (they're LLVM global constants), preserve
SSA, and match what LLVM's own freeze-then-propagate would produce.

Pointer-typed phi operands are left as undef; SPIR-V's OpConstantNull is
forbidden on PhysicalStorageBuffer, and the SPIR-V emitter has a dedicated
workaround that materializes an `OpConvertUToPtr` from ulong_0 in the
predecessor block (see emit.jl's deferred-phi handling).

# ── `loop-rotate`: tried, measured, NOT added ────────────────────────────────
#
# The obvious suspect for the barrier hazard in `test_shared_index_division.jl`
# was that this pipeline never rotates loops, where AMD's — which the sequence
# below otherwise mirrors — gets rotation from the general optimisation pipeline
# long before structurization. A top-tested `while` was structurizing into a loop
# whose header branches to the *continue target* to exit; a counted `for`, which
# Julia already lowers rotated, did not, and only the `while` lost workgroup
# memory across its barrier.
#
# Adding it is three lines — it is a loop pass, so it needs the
# `function(loop(loop-rotate))` nesting rather than a bare `LLVM.run!`:
#
#     @dispose pb = LLVM.NewPMPassBuilder() begin
#         LLVM.add!(pb, LLVM.NewPMFunctionPassManager()) do fpm
#             LLVM.add!(fpm, LLVM.NewPMLoopPassManager()) do lpm
#                 LLVM.add!(lpm, LLVM.LoopRotatePass())
#             end
#         end
#         LLVM.run!(pb, mod)
#     end
#
# **It works and it does not help.** The `while` loop's header does come out with
# an unconditional `OpBranch` into the body afterwards — the rotation happened —
# and the shared block is still corrupted exactly as before. The GEMM measured
# 1.53x against the register-blocked kernel with it and 1.52x without, i.e. a
# wash. So the loop shape is not the mechanism, and a transform pass in a
# structurization pipeline with no benefit is a mysterious regression waiting to
# happen. Left out, recorded here so it is not re-derived.

Run the full CFG structurization pipeline required for Vulkan SPIR-V.

This is the standard LLVM pass sequence used by AMD's GPU compiler, with our
pre-StructurizeCFG fixup pass inserted:

1. SimplifyCFG - merges nested conditionals sharing exit blocks
2. fixup_structured_cfg! - trampoline insertion for shared merge targets
3. LowerSwitch - converts switch to if-else chains (SPIR-V OpSwitch has limitations)
4. UnifyFunctionExitNodes - ensures single return point (required by StructurizeCFG)
5. FixIrreducible - converts irreducible loops to reducible ones
6. LoopSimplify - creates dedicated exit blocks for nested loops, preventing
   StructurizeCFG from producing constant `br i1 true` on inner loop back-edges
   when inner loops have multi-level exits (exits bypassing outer loops)
7. StructurizeCFG - the critical pass: converts arbitrary CFG to structured control flow
8. InstCombine - cleanup bitcasts from StructurizeCFG's reg2mem patterns
   NOTE: Do NOT run SimplifyCFG after StructurizeCFG -- it destroys structured flow!
9. fixup_post_structurize! - insert trampolines for continue-target merge conflicts

Deliberately NOT here: `loop-rotate`. See the note above it.

`LAVA_SKIP_PASSES` takes a comma-separated list of the names below and drops
those passes. It exists because the pipeline's failure mode is a *miscompile* —
a kernel that compiles, validates and computes the wrong answer — and the only
handle on one of those is to find which pass introduces it. Dropping a pass will
often produce invalid SPIR-V instead, and that is a useful answer too: it says
the pass is load-bearing rather than implicated.
