# AcceleratedMatrix — an `AbstractMatrix` whose elements live in subgroup-scope
# matrix hardware (tensor cores) rather than in Julia.
#
# The operations it does support are ordinary Base functions -- `size`, `zero`,
# `*`, `muladd`, `copyto!` -- given device-specific implementations by the
# compiler. It is not an `AbstractMatrix`, because it has no addressable
# elements; see the docstring.
#
# It is *opaque*, so it holds no element storage. A cooperative matrix's value
# is distributed across the lanes of a subgroup with an implementation-defined
# layout; it lives in registers the emitter names, never in a Julia field. The
# single `handle` field is not data — it is an SSA anchor. A zero-field struct
# would be erased by LLVM and two distinct matrices would collapse into one
# value, so `muladd(a, b, c)` needs something per-instance to keep them apart.
# The emitter maps each handle to an `OpCooperativeMatrix*` result id.
#
# There is deliberately no second "scalar" implementation inside this type. On a
# device without cooperative matrices the fallback is `MMatrix`, which is
# already a perfectly good `AbstractMatrix`. Write kernels generically over
# `AbstractMatrix` and instantiate with whichever the device supports -- that is
# lava-dnn.md's "capability dispatch selected at instantiate from a device
# query", with no dispatch machinery of our own.
#
# `Use` records which operand position the matrix occupies in `A*B + C`. SPIR-V
# fixes it when the type is created, so it cannot be inferred afterwards -- the
# same way `Adjoint` and `Transpose` are part of the type in Base.

    AcceleratedMatrix{T,M,N,Use}

An `M×N` matrix of `T` held in subgroup-scope matrix hardware.

Supports `size`, `zero`, `*`, `muladd`, `copyto!` and the
`(src, offset, stride)` constructor — ordinary Base functions, lowered by the
compiler to cooperative-matrix instructions.

Deliberately NOT an `AbstractMatrix`: there is no addressable `(row, column)`.
The layout across the subgroup is implementation-defined, and the only element
access SPIR-V exposes is into *this invocation's* fragment, whose length bears
no fixed relation to `(M, N)`. Subtyping `AbstractMatrix` would promise an
indexing contract the hardware cannot honour, and generic Base code would then
fail deep inside a fallback instead of at the call site. Use `MMatrix` when you
need element access — which is also the fallback on devices without
cooperative matrices.

Device-only: the value is spread across a subgroup's lanes and cannot be
allocated host-side or outlive the invocation, like `@private`/`@localmem`.
