# Command buffer recording and dispatch for Lava.jl
#
# Batch-based command buffer management: each CommandBatch owns its own
# command buffer and strong refs (via `batch.pinned`) to every GPU object
# the dispatch references.  Retirement is synchronous: `sweep_retired_batches!`
# polls each queue's timeline semaphore and recycles batches whose signal
# value has been reached.
#
# GC safety: every dispatch `pin!`s its arg buffers + pipelines + other
# GPU-referenced objects into `batch.pinned`.  Objects remain reachable until
# the timeline semaphore reaches `batch.signal_value`, at which point
# `reclaim_batch!` empties `batch.pinned` and returns the batch to the free
# pool.  Vulkan destructors fired by Julia's GC (via DataRef refcount) hit
# the deferred-free path in `memory.jl`, which itself waits on the same
# timeline before destroying the underlying `VkBuffer`.
#
# Cross-queue sync: at `submit!` time, `sync_access!(batch, buf)` walks every
# pinned object and, for `VkManagedBuffer`s, inserts a timeline-semaphore wait
# on the prior writing queue (if any) and updates `buf.last_write` to this
# batch's (bq, signal_value).

# Flush counter for benchmarking (atomic for thread safety)

# Global dispatch counter for debugging (total dispatches across all flushes)

# Dispatch info for debugging DEVICE_LOST

# Ring buffer of last N dispatch names for crash debugging
const MAX_DISPATCH_LOG = 2000

# Toggle dispatch logging (disabled by default for zero-alloc dispatch path).
# Enable with `ctx.diag.dispatch_logging = true` for debugging.
# On DEVICE_LOST, the error handler re-enables logging automatically.
# TEMP DEBUG: if true, submit! waits for the batch it just submitted to complete
# and records wall-clock GPU time in BATCH_WAIT_TIMES. This SERIALIZES the pipeline
# — only for measurement, not production. Used to identify batches whose actual
# GPU execution time is near the amdgpu TDR threshold (~10 s).

"""
Path to mirror the dispatch log to, or `nothing`.

The in-memory ring buffer is worthless for the failure it exists to diagnose: a
dispatch that never completes leaves the process blocked inside
`vkWaitForFences`, where nothing can print it and SIGINT does not land, so the
log dies with the session. Set this and each dispatch name is appended and
flushed as it is recorded, which makes the last line in the file the kernel that
hung.

Off by default — it is a write and a flush per dispatch, on a path whose whole
point is to allocate nothing.

Build a dispatch's log string, behind an `invokelatest`.

String interpolation reaches `print`/`show`, and `show` is a function every

# Default 3000 ≈ 1 Hikari volpath sample (50 bounces × 60 dispatches/bounce).
# Set to 0 to disable splitting.

# Auto-submit threshold: submit the current batch (starting a new one on the
# next dispatch) when its dispatch count reaches this value. Measured per-batch
# GPU execution time is capped at ~51 ms on dolphin HQ (well under amdgpu's
# ~10 s TDR) so the original TDR hypothesis this was meant to address turned
# out to be wrong.
#
# It is worth a great deal for a different reason. With this disabled, nothing
# reaches the queue until `flush!`, so recording the host side of a workload and
# executing it on the GPU are strictly serial: the card sits idle for the whole
# recording pass and the host sits idle for the whole execution pass. On the
# MatAnyone inference step (~2050 dispatches, 16.3 ms to record, ~12 ms to
# execute) that is 28.1 ms a step; submitting every 64 dispatches lets the two
# overlap and the same step takes 19.3 ms — 35.6 to 51.9 steps/s for a one-line
# change, with the GPU now starting its first work ~64 dispatches in instead of
# 2050.
#
# 64 is a floor, not a peak: the curve is flat from 16 to 96 (19.3-20.8 ms) and
# degrades outside it — below 16 the per-submit cost (fence, command buffer,
# retire sweep) starts to show, above 128 the overlap window shrinks back.
# Workloads with fewer than 64 dispatches per flush never reach it and are
# unaffected.


# ── Capture / replay ──
#
# A workload whose launch sequence is identical every iteration pays to rebuild
# that sequence every iteration. On the MatAnyone inference step that is 12.1 ms
# of host time against 11.6 ms of GPU time — recording the step costs slightly
# more than running it. Capturing the command buffers once and re-submitting
# them removes the recording entirely.
#
# The precondition is that every device address the recorded commands refer to
# is the same next time: a statically planned slab (DNNKernels' `planslab`), fixed
# weights, and an input buffer written in place rather than reallocated. Command
# buffers recorded under `capture` therefore use SIMULTANEOUS_USE rather than
# ONE_TIME_SUBMIT, and ownership of them moves to the `CapturedSequence` so the
# batch pool can never re-record over one.
#
# Arg buffers are the subtle part. `pack_args_direct!` writes each dispatch's
# arguments into a bump-allocated slab and bakes that slab's address into the
# command buffer as a push constant, so a replay reads whatever those bytes hold
# *now*. Nothing rewrites them as long as no other recording happens on this
# queue between replays — which is why `capture` reserves the slab range it used
# instead of letting `reset_arg_buffer_pool!` hand it out again.

# Inside a plain `concurrent_dispatch_group` that forced barrier serialises

# (Hikari's 12 per-material shading kernels per bounce).

# the group into three phases:
#   1. While `f()` runs, `ka_launch_indirect!` packs args + allocates the
#      indirect slot for each dispatch but records NOTHING — it defers
#      (pipeline, args, indirect slot, queue-size buffer, workgroup size)
#      into `bq.deferred_indirect`.
#   2. On exit, ONE fused multi-prepare dispatch writes every deferred
#      indirect command (a single thread looping over the slots — same
#      pattern as `empty_all!`). Its normal pre-barrier orders it after
#      the producers that filled the queues.
#   3. The dispatches record back-to-back: the FIRST carries one barrier
#      (orders ALL subsequent commands after the multi-prepare's writes,
#      with INDIRECT_COMMAND_READ access), the rest skip — they only share
#      atomically-claimed queue slots, same contract as a plain concurrent
#      group.

# commands; all N dispatches free to overlap on the GPU.

    # FIRST dispatch inside a group still barriers (producer→consumer),
    # but all subsequent dispatches inside the group skip.

    # `force_pre_barrier=true` overrides BOTH skip mechanisms. Indirect
    # dispatches (vk_dispatch_indirect!/rt) must use it: the command
    # processor's read of the VkDispatchIndirectCommand depends on the
    # immediately preceding prepare-indirect kernel's write. Inside a

    # the first rendered black because round-0's trace dispatch read a
    # clobbered queue pointer).

    # batches that recorded them, and every dispatch in them keeps reading its
    # arguments from the slab at replay time. So the bytes of batches that have
    # already been submitted AND signalled are still live — the one case this
    # test otherwise treats as the safest of all. Mid-capture the queue drains to
    # empty routinely (the GPU is running a step's worth of work while the host
    # records the next), so without this the second half of a capture overwrites
    # the argument records of the first, and the replay dispatches valid commands
    # against wrong pointers: no validation error, no device fault, just a kernel
    # that never returns. `capture` pins the range at the end via

#   * a kernel that is genuinely slow or wedged — the counter sits one below
#     `target`, the batch that signals it is in flight, and the dispatch log

#   * a wait on a value nothing will signal — every in-flight batch has already
#     been signalled (`signal_value <= counter`) yet `target` is higher, or a
#     batch waits on a value above the counter that no queued batch signals. A

#     also blocks the batch that would have signalled past it: a deadlock, not
#     slowness.

# (4 in-flight batches, a target that never arrives), and it could not be told
# from the first without this. Cheap: three queries, only on the failure path.

# Two phases, two functions.  Every object a dispatch touches goes through:
#
#   1. `pin!(batch, obj)` — called from the @generated arg-pack walker and
#      from dispatch entry points (rt_dispatch!, vk_draw!).  Idempotent
#      insert into `batch.pinned::IdSet`.  User never calls this.
#
#   2. `sync_access!(batch, obj)` — invoked in `submit!` once per pinned
#      object, before queue_submit_2.  Default is no-op.  `VkManagedBuffer`
#      specialization updates `last_write` and inserts a cross-queue timeline-
#      semaphore wait when the prior writer was on a different queue.
#
# Overloadable per type: a new resource kind adds `pin!(batch, ::MyRes)`
# (optional; generic method already handles it) and `sync_access!(batch,
# ::MyRes)` (optional; default no-op).  No edits to the pack walker or to
# submit! required.

"""

Keep `obj` alive until this batch's timeline signals.  Idempotent: repeated
calls with the same `obj` (within one batch) are no-ops.  `VkManagedBuffer`
specialization additionally asserts the ctx invariant so cross-context use
surfaces immediately.

Called from `pack_args_direct!` at each buffer-typed leaf, and directly at
dispatch entry points for objects not in the kernel arg tuple (pipelines,
closures, RT AS handles, indirect buffers).
