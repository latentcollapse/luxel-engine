# Lava Profiling — kernel stats + per-dispatch GPU timing + driver pipeline introspection.
#
# Three orthogonal capabilities, all opt-in / off by default:
#
#   1. `kernel_stats(compiled)` — pure SPIR-V analysis (size, instruction count,
#      Op histogram). Zero runtime cost; works without a render in flight.
#   2. `with_dispatch_timing(f)` — wrap a render with Vulkan timestamp queries
#      around every dispatch. Returns a per-kernel-name aggregated report.
#      Adds two `vkCmdWriteTimestamp` calls per dispatch when enabled; the
#      hot path is untouched when disabled.
#   3. `pipeline_exec_stats(linked)` — driver-side stats via
#      `VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties` (register count, scratch,
#      vendor-specific ISA). Only available when the extension is enabled
#      via `Lava.enable_pipeline_executable_properties!()` BEFORE device
#      creation. Returns `nothing` otherwise.
#
# Designed to stay in the codebase. No `# TODO: remove` markers anywhere.

    kernel_source_name(compiled) -> String

The Julia kernel a compiled module came from, recovered from its LLVM IR.

`entry_name` is the SPIR-V entry point, and Lava names every compute entry
`main` — so a list of `KernelStats` was a list of identical `"main"`s and could
not be attributed to anything. That is not cosmetic: it is what made
`list_compiled_kernels` unusable for the question it exists to answer, and why a
table joining GPU time to register counts had nothing to join *on*.

NOT from the `define` line: by the time this IR exists the entry has already been
renamed, so every module defines exactly one function and it is called `@main`.
The original name survives further down, in the mangled symbol and in inlining
labels — `_Z15gpu_fcpd_scale_16CompilerMetadataI...` and `julia_gpu_fcpd_scale`.

`CompilerMetadata` is the anchor: KernelAbstractions gives every `@kernel` that
as its first argument, so the name is exactly what precedes it in the mangled
symbol. `julia_<name>` is the fallback for anything not shaped that way.

Returns `""` rather than throwing when neither matches: a profiler must not be
the thing that fails.

iterated at the wrong depth.

`get_compiled_kernel_and_pipeline` consults the frozen cache first and *returns*
on a hit, so a kernel that came off disk never reaches
`GPUCompiler.cached_compilation` and never enters `caches.linked`. Every runner
calls `use_frozen_kernels` in its `__init__`, so for the configuration that
actually ships `caches.linked` is empty and this returned an empty vector —
measured on a Depth Anything forward: **0 kernels reported against 45 live
dispatch names**, taking `kernel_stats`, `pipeline_exec_stats` and every

    pipeline_exec_stats(linked::LavaLinkedKernel) -> NamedTuple or Nothing

Query `VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties` for a linked compute pipeline.
Returns a NamedTuple `(registers, scratch_bytes, raw_stats)` where:

- `registers::Union{Int,Nothing}` — driver's "registers per thread" or
  similar; nothing if no matching statistic was returned.
- `scratch_bytes::Union{Int,Nothing}` — driver's scratch/spill bytes if
  reported.
- `raw_stats::Vector{NamedTuple}` — every statistic the driver returned,
  with `name`, `description`, `value_kind`, `value` fields.

Returns `nothing` if the extension wasn't enabled at device creation, or
if the driver doesn't expose anything for this pipeline.
