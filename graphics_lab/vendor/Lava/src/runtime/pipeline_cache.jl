# VkPipelineCache persistence.
#
# A single VkPipelineCache per device, seeded from disk and saved back so
# AMDVLK / RADV / etc. don't recompile SPIR-V → ISA every session. Lives in the
# same scratchspace as the SPIR-V cache (`lava_disk_cache_dir()`) for cohesion.
#
# Safety: the header is validated HERE, before the driver ever sees the bytes.
#
# The spec says an implementation must detect incompatible `pInitialData` and
# behave as if the cache were empty, and it is tempting to lean on that — the
# blob carries vendor/device IDs and a cache UUID precisely so it can be
# checked. Drivers are not reliably defensive about it in practice: a blob from
# another device, or one truncated by a half-written file, is a documented way
# to crash inside `vkCreatePipelineCache`, and a crash there takes the process
# with it before any Julia-level `try` can see it. `catch` does not help
# against a segfault.
#
# So the 32-byte `VkPipelineCacheHeaderVersionOne` is parsed and compared
# against this physical device before the data is passed on, and anything that
# does not match exactly is discarded. That is cheap, it is the one check that
# makes the "load whatever is on disk" path safe, and it is what lets the
# frozen kernel cache keep a driver-specific level at all.

Whether `bytes` is a pipeline-cache blob this device will accept.

Parses `VkPipelineCacheHeaderVersionOne` — `headerSize`, `headerVersion`,

requires every field to match the device. The UUID is the authoritative one: a
driver update changes it even when vendor and device do not, which is exactly
the case a filename keyed on the driver *version string* can miss (two builds
can report the same version).

Checked here rather than delegated to `vkCreatePipelineCache` because a
mismatch there is not reliably a clean rejection. See the note at the top of
