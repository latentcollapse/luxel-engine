"""
The types `VkContext` has to name, hoisted ahead of it.

Nothing here is new and nothing here has behaviour — these are the `struct`
blocks that used to sit beside the functions that use them, moved so that
`VkContext` can hold its per-device state in **concrete typed fields** instead of
module-level dictionaries keyed by `ctx.id`.

That keying was the shortcut: it made two devices work without touching call
sites, and the probe that followed found seven real defects. But it left twelve
globals whose entries outlive the device they describe, and a `RESET_CALLBACKS`
mechanism whose entire job was emptying them. State owned by the context needs
neither.

Only the definitions moved. Every constructor, method and comment about
*behaviour* stayed where it was, because include order constrains types and not
methods — Julia resolves a call at the first invocation, long after every file
is loaded.

Two `Any` fields survive, and both predate this: `PoolBlock.pool` (a `DevicePool`
holds a `Vector{PoolBlock}`, so one direction must be untyped) and
`VkManagedBuffer.ctx`/`last_write` (a `VkContext` is what owns the pool that owns
the buffer). Those are genuine cycles; the rest were only ordering.

One device's memory: its 64 MiB blocks and its per-size-class free lists.

**This was two module-level globals**, `POOL_BLOCKS` and `POOL_FREE_LISTS`, and
`PoolBlock` carried no device. So an allocation on a second device was served out
of the first device's block — measured directly: allocate on the GPU (one block
created), then allocate on lavapipe, and `length(POOL_BLOCKS)` was *still 1*.

The buffer's `ctx` was right and the memory under it belonged to the other
device, which is the worst shape a bug can have: `fill!` on the second context
read back **0.0** because it wrote into memory that device does not own, and the
same sequence in a different order segfaulted instead.

Worth separating from `GUARDRAILS.md` §8, which lists four caches holding
pipeline *handles*. This hands out *memory*. A stale handle is undefined
behaviour the driver usually catches; memory from the wrong device is silent
corruption, and no amount of cache keying reaches it. Every one of those four
caches was keyed per device before this, and two devices still did not work.

Everything a dispatch needs that depends only on the *types* of its arguments.

`ka_launch!` used to rebuild `Tuple{map(arg_sigtype, tail(all_args))...}` on
every single dispatch and hand it to `GPUCompiler.methodinstance`: that interns
a fresh `Type` object, does a method lookup, and then two hash lookups keyed on
that type and a freshly built compiler config — all to rediscover a pipeline it
had already compiled. Types hash and compare slowly, and at ~2000 dispatches per
MatAnyone inference step this was the largest single host cost in the loop.

`typeof(all_args)` is available for free and types are interned, so an `IdDict`
keyed on it is a pointer hash. Everything downstream — pipeline, arg layout,
buffer size — is a function of exactly that, so it is all cached together.

The world counter is stored with the entry and checked on each hit. It moves on
any method definition, so redefining a kernel (Revise, or a first-time
specialisation) drops back to the slow path for one call and re-caches; a stale
pipeline can never be served.

**These were eighteen module-level `Ref`s.** They are the same mistake as the

allocation tracing or dispatch logging did it for *every* device in the process,
and a second device could not be instrumented independently of the first. Two of
them carry counters (`spirv_dump_counter`, `kernel_debug_counter`) whose values
were shared across devices that emit different kernels.

`DNNKernels` did exactly this in its own step 3 — `OPTIMES`, `OPDOUBLE`,
`OPDOUBLEFILTER`, `PLAN_MISSES` and `LAUNCH_PROBE` became `Ctx.diag` — and the
argument there applies here: two differently-instrumented runs at once become
possible, and nothing has to be reset.

Every validation and instrumentation setting, chosen **at device construction**.

    Lava.vk_reset_device!(debug = DebugConfig(gpu_av = true))   # replace the default device
    ctx = VkContext(debug = DebugConfig(gpu_av = true))         # or build a separate one

**That is the whole API.** There is no `enable_gpu_av()`, no environment
variable, and no way to switch any of this on after the fact — all of these are
properties of the `VkInstance`, fixed by `vkCreateInstance`, so a setting applied
to a device that already exists cannot take effect. There were five preset
functions and seven `LAVA_*` variables; every one of them is deleted, because
each was another way to reach a configuration slightly different from the one you
asked for.

The two recipes worth knowing:

    DebugConfig(validation = true)                       # core spec checks, cheap
    DebugConfig(gpu_av = true, pool_disabled = true)     # + shader OOB, sub-pool visible

After the second, call [`verify_gpu_av`](@ref). "GPU-AV is enabled" and "GPU-AV
is catching errors" are not the same thing on every driver, and a clean run under
an instrument that never fired reads exactly like a clean run.

This was seven environment variables — `LAVA_VALIDATION`, `LAVA_GPU_AV`,
`LAVA_GPU_AV_SAFE`, `LAVA_GPU_AV_SHADERS`, `LAVA_SYNC_VAL`, `LAVA_BEST`,
`LAVA_DEBUG_PRINTF` — read here at instance creation. They are **deleted**, not
deprecated, because the failure they produced was not occasional: setting one in
an already-running session did nothing at all, and setting `LAVA_GPU_AV` without
`LAVA_VALIDATION` produced a *clean run with the instrument switched off*, which
reads exactly like "no fault found". Both are unrepresentable here.

## The two rules, enforced in the constructor rather than warned about

`validation` is implied by everything else. GPU-AV, sync validation,
best practices and debug printf are all features **of** the Khronos validation
layer, so asking for one turns the layer on. Passing `validation = true` alone
means core spec checks with no shader instrumentation, which is the cheap mode.

`gpu_av` and `printf` are mutually exclusive and **throw** together. The layer
instruments shaders for each and cannot do both; the previous behaviour was to
silently prefer printf and warn, which is one more way to get a clean run out of
a disabled instrument.

## Two settings that exist because GPU-AV crashes

`gpu_av_safe` defaults to **true**, unlike everything else here. Khronos' own
documentation: "Safe Mode will have GPU-AV try and prevent crashes, but will be
much slower to validate, and when using Safe Mode, selective shader
instrumentation is recommended to only instrument the shaders/pipelines causing
issues." Lava shipped GPU-AV with neither for a long time, which is most of why
reaching for it produced a SIGSEGV rather than a report.

`gpu_av_shaders` names the kernels to instrument; empty means all of them, which
on a ~99-kernel model is both very slow and the configuration most likely to fall
over. Both need `VK_EXT_layer_settings` — `VkValidationFeaturesEXT` cannot
express either.

## `pool_disabled`, which is here because it is a debugging setting

GPU-AV tracks buffer-device-address bounds **per `VkBuffer`**, and Lava's pool
puts many `LavaArray`s into one shared 64 MiB block. So with the pool on, GPU-AV
sees overruns past the whole block and is *blind to sub-pool overruns* — which
are most of the bugs anyone turns it on to find. `pool_disabled = true` gives
every array its own `VkBuffer`.

Debug-only: allocation is much slower and the path is less exercised than the
pooled one (the host-upload and flush-after-error paths may misbehave). It lives
on this struct rather than as a separate `pool(ctx).disabled = true` step because
a second step is a second way to get it wrong, and it applies to the device being
built.

so two contexts meant two messengers writing into ONE ring. Device A's validation
errors surfaced in device B's `get_validation_messages()`, and

consumed the other's messages.

`VkDebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfoEXT` carries a `pUserData` pointer for exactly
this, and `debug_callback` already took (and ignored) it.

The arrays are allocated once and never resized, so the pointers cached in `raw`
stay valid; `raw` is a `RefValue` because its own address is what gets handed to

`pad_to_3d(ctx, …)`, which reads `ctx.max_wg_dims` — so a plan describes one
device, and the cache holding it has to belong to that device.

    DeviceCaps

What a kernel needs to know about the device it is about to run on, answered once
per device. Read it with [`caps`](@ref), which fills it lazily and leaves it on
the context — the cooperative-matrix and subgroup answers need a live *logical*
device, so this cannot be built from physical-device properties at selection time
the way its predecessor was.

Three things became this one: `DeviceCompute` (SM count, warps per SM,
shared-memory ceiling), `WORKGROUP_LIMIT`, and `DNNKernels.Device`. They
described the same thing at three scopes — a struct read once per device, a
module-level `Ref(1024)` whose own docstring claimed to be "the device's own
`maxComputeWorkGroupInvocations`" while being a constant, and a copy of the whole
set rebuilt in a downstream package out of eight separate Lava lookups. Every
number here belongs to the device, so the device is what carries them.

`cores` and `warps` are **0 when the device does not report them**. Vulkan has no
core query: NVIDIA exposes it through `VK_NV_shader_sm_builtins`, AMD through
`VK_AMD_shader_core_properties2`, everyone else through nothing. Read them via
[`shader_core_count`](@ref) / [`shader_warps_per_sm`](@ref), which return
`nothing` for unknown — a missing fallback is then a `MethodError` at the first
arithmetic rather than a silently empty grid.

`coopmatsubgroup` is **not** `subgroup`. Lava pins any module declaring
`CooperativeMatrixKHR` to `COOPMAT_SUBGROUP` through `VK_EXT_subgroup_size_control`
(`pipeline.jl`), because a cooperative matrix is subgroup-scoped and the kernels
index subgroups as `tid ÷ 32`. On RDNA 3.5 the device default is 64 while the
pipeline still runs 32 — a coopmat workgroup sized in units of `subgroup` would
ask for twice the threads the kernel indexes, and write part of its tile.

    DeviceCaches

Everything a `VkContext` caches, owned by the context that owns the handles.

**These were twelve module-level globals.** Ten had been keyed by `ctx.id` to
make two devices work, which fixed the sharing but not the ownership: entries
outlived the device they described, `ctx.id` was a surrogate for "the object I
should have stored this on", and `RESET_CALLBACKS` existed almost entirely to
empty them. A field dies with its context, so none of that is needed.

The last two — `BLIT_PIPELINE` and `TIMESTAMP_POOL` — were never keyed at all.
They are module-level `Ref`s holding device-owned handles, which is precisely the
shape that produced the function-pointer crash and the memory-pool corruption;
they survived only because the two-device probe's path (dispatch, reduction,
GEMM) reaches neither graphics nor dispatch profiling.

`blit` is `Any` because `GraphicsPipeline` is defined near the end of the include
list — no worse than the `Ref{Any}` it replaces, and the only field that is not
concrete.
