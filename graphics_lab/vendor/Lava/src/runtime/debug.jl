# Debug / validation: the PROOF step.
#
# There is exactly one way to switch validation on, and it is not in this file:
#
#     Lava.vk_reset_device!(debug = DebugConfig(gpu_av = true, pool_disabled = true))
#
# See `DebugConfig` and `vk_reset_device!`. This file used to hold five preset
# functions — `enable_gpu_av`, `disable_gpu_av`, `enable_debug_printf!`,
# `disable_debug_printf!`, `activate_all_debugging` — over seven `LAVA_*`
# environment variables. All twelve are deleted. Each preset encoded a slightly
# different combination (`enable_gpu_av` defaulted to `pool_disabled = false`,
# which its own docstring then explained was blind to the bugs you turn GPU-AV on
# to find), so "which one do I call" was itself a way to end up instrumented for
# something other than what you were hunting.
#
# What remains here is the one thing a config object cannot express, because it
# is a measurement rather than a setting: **"GPU-AV is enabled" and "GPU-AV is
# catching errors" are not the same thing on every driver.** `verify_gpu_av` runs
# a known out-of-bounds write and asserts the layer reports it, so a passing call
# is proof end-to-end and a clean run afterwards means something.

"""
    Lava.verify_gpu_av(; timeout=10.0) -> Bool

Run a known out-of-bounds device write and assert that the GPU-AV layer
reports it via its debug-utils callback. Returns `true` on success; throws
`LavaError` if the layer did not catch the OOB within `timeout` seconds.

**Call this every time you switch GPU-AV on.** It is the only step that can tell
you the instrument is live, and skipping it is how a clean run gets mistaken for
"no fault found":

    Lava.vk_reset_device!(debug = DebugConfig(gpu_av = true, pool_disabled = true))
    Lava.verify_gpu_av()

**It can take the process with it, and that is also an answer.** GPU-AV can
attach (`gpu_assisted = true`) and still silently fail to instrument shaders on
some driver/loader combinations — observed on RADV / Mesa 26 here: the layer
attaches, never fires, and this probe's deliberate out-of-bounds write
**segfaults the process** rather than being reported. So a segfault or a thrown
`LavaError` here is definitive: GPU-AV is non-functional on this driver, and
anything you were about to conclude from a clean run under it means nothing. Do
GPU-AV bug-hunting on a driver where this returns cleanly.

The non-instrumenting layers need no probe — nothing about
`DebugConfig(sync_val = true, best_practices = true)` can silently not-instrument
— so that is the configuration to reach for when you want to keep the session
alive.

Uses a write at index `100_000_000_000` (~400 GB past the array start), so
the destination address is past every possible underlying `VkBuffer` —
this proves the layer is alive whether or not `pool_disabled` is set.

Implementation: the flush after a GPU-AV-caught dispatch can hang in cleanup
on some drivers (observed on AMDVLK Windows), so the flush is spawned on a
worker task and the main task polls `ctx.validation.messages` until either the
expected message appears or the timeout expires. On success, the function
calls `vk_reset_device!` to clear the half-flushed batch state.
