could just as easily be Lava's in-memory `ctx.caches.pipelines` rather than the

This is how to prove a cache is doing its job. Timing cannot: a fast second run
is equally explained by Lava's in-memory `ctx.caches.pipelines`, which never
touches disk. Under this wrapper, a run that completes did zero driver
compilation — the driver said so.

Clears Lava's in-memory pipeline cache first, so only the `VkPipelineCache`

    spirv_content_hash(bytes) -> UInt64

A hash over **every** byte of a SPIR-V module.

`Base.hash` on a large `Vector` deliberately *samples* elements instead of
reading all of them. For a dictionary of distinct arrays that is a sensible
trade; as a pipeline-cache key it is a silent-wrong-results bug, because two
instantiations of one kernel can differ in a handful of bytes and nothing else.

Measured: the 256- and 512-wide instantiations of the same kernel produce modules
that differ at **exactly one byte** — index 230, the `LocalSize` x operand — and
`hash` returns the identical value for both. The 512-wide launch therefore looked
up the 256-wide pipeline, dispatched a 256-thread shader over a grid computed for
512, and wrote exactly half its output. At 1024 it wrote a quarter. Whichever
size compiled first won, which is why it looked order- and body-dependent, and
why adding any unrelated store "fixed" it (different bytes, no collision).

That is the entire content of what was recorded for a long time as "above 256
this device silently runs fewer invocations than the shader declares". The device
runs every lane.

FNV-1a, because it reads every byte and needs no dependency. A 9 KB module costs
microseconds, and this runs once per pipeline creation, never per launch.

"""
    alloc_compute_tlas_descriptor_set(dev, pipeline, tlas) -> (DescriptorPool, DescriptorSet)

Allocate a fresh descriptor pool and descriptor set that binds `tlas.accel`
to set=0, binding=0 for a compute pipeline compiled with
`needs_tlas_descriptor=true`. The caller MUST `pin!(batch, pool)` so the
pool stays alive until the dispatch retires; once the batch is reclaimed
the pool's destructor frees it.

We deliberately do NOT cache here. A previous version keyed a cache by
`(ds_layout, objectid(LavaTLAS))`, but `Raycore.sync!` produces a new
LavaTLAS each rebuild → cache misses → unbounded growth → eviction with
WeakRef-based TLAS-GC detection that lags Julia GC → pools destroyed
while their descriptor sets were still in flight on the GPU. Per-dispatch
allocation is microseconds and removes the entire class of bug.

`tlas` is a `LavaTLAS` — declared later in raytracing/acceleration.jl.
