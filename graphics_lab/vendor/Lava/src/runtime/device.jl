    query_shader_cores(phys_dev) -> (cores, warps)

The SM/CU count and warps per SM, or `(0, 0)` where the device will not say.

A grid that does not fill the device is the dominant cost on small shapes — SAM
2's decode runs one attention at 8 workgroups on 48 SMs — so "how many workgroups
before the device is busy" is a number kernels need, and before it was queried
they hardcoded it.

Vendor coverage follows llama.cpp's `ggml-vulkan.cpp:6138-6146`, which is the
same question asked by the same kind of code. Neither extension is *enabled* on
the logical device — these are physical-device property queries and enabling
would be pointless — but the chained struct is only filled for an extension the
device advertises, so each is guarded by `has_extension`.

The chain is also only filled when the instance opted into
`vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2`: core in Vulkan 1.1, or the
`VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2` instance extension before that. Lava's
instance asks for 1.4 (see `create_vulkan_context`), so this holds — but note the
failure is silent if it ever stops holding. The base properties still come back
fully populated and only the `next` chain is dropped, with no return code to
check, because `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2` returns void.

    # That is an immediate segfault rather than a wrong answer, which makes it

    # A counter rather than `objectid(ctx)`: object ids are reused after the

    # also survives `vk_reset_device!`, which builds a new context, so entries
    # from before a reset can never be handed to after it.
    #
    # It survives as an identity — for logging, and for the probe's assertion
    # that two contexts are distinct — but it is no longer a cache key. It was
    # one, and this comment used to argue that keying was as good as ownership
    # because the cached value types are defined in files included after this
    # one, so a field would have to be `Any` and cost inference on a lookup per
    # dispatch. The premise was true and the conclusion was wrong: the fix is to

1. **Recovery**, after `ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` or another unrecoverable error:

2. **Switching validation on or off** — and this is the *only* way, because those

    VkContext(; select = pick_physical_device, debug = DebugConfig()) -> VkContext

Build a device. **Does not install it** as the process default — `vk_context()`
is what does that, and it is the only caller that should.

This is the explicit constructor. Reach for it when you want a *specific* device,
or a device with validation on; `vk_context()` is the lazy default for everything
else.

`debug` is where every validation and instrumentation setting is chosen, and the
only place they can be: they configure the `VkInstance` and are fixed by
`vkCreateInstance`, so nothing set afterwards reaches a device that already
exists. See [`DebugConfig`](@ref) — it replaced seven environment variables that
were read here, two of whose failure modes were silent.

    ctx = VkContext(debug = DebugConfig(gpu_av = true, gpu_av_shaders = ["step_kernel"]))

`select` receives the enumerated physical devices and returns one, so a caller
can ask for a device other than the one `pick_physical_device` prefers. That is
what makes a two-device test possible on a single-GPU machine: the loader
enumerates the real GPU *and* lavapipe from one instance, so

    gpu = vk_context()
    cpu = VkContext(select = devs -> only(filter(islavapipe, devs)))

gives two live contexts with two distinct `id`s, which is the pair every
per-device cache key has to be checked against (`GUARDRAILS.md` §8). Before this
there was no way to ask for the second device at all, so the acceptance test the
briefs describe could not be written.
