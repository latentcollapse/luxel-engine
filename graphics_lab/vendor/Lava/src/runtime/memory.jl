# Per-finalizer destruction trace

# Per-allocation trace

# When enabled, vk_free! scans every live BatchQueue's arg/indirect slabs for
# any UInt64 == buf.address.  Hits are logged + zeroed so the GPU faults on a
# clean null reference instead of corrupting random memory.  Optionally
# throws a LavaError instead of just logging (`ctx.diag.destroy_freed_bdas_throws`).

# Pre-submit unknown-BDA scan: scans the active arg slab region for any
# BDA-shaped UInt64 that isn't in the pool's `live_buffers` or any pool block / slab.
# Optionally throws a LavaError instead of just warning.

# When true, pack_arg!(::VkManagedBuffer, ...) asserts the buffer's state ==
# ALIVE before packing its BDA.  Catches use-after-free where a stale buffer
# reference makes it through to a kernel arg.

# When set to a non-zero target BDA, every submit! scans the active arg slab
# for the target value and logs (submit_idx, offsets) to `diag.slab_dump_log`.  Used
# to track when a known-stale address enters/leaves the arg slab.

"""
    scan_arg_slabs_for_bda!(buf) -> Int

Scan every live BatchQueue's `arg_slabs` (and `indirect_slabs`) for any
UInt64 word matching `buf.address`.  For each hit, append a record to
`diag.freed_bda_scan_log` and overwrite the slot with 0 so the GPU faults
cleanly on a null reference instead of touching the freed memory.
Returns the number of hits found.

Defined AFTER VkManagedBuffer + BatchQueue (forward-call from vk_free!).
Cost is ~`(slab_size_bytes / 8)` UInt64 reads per live slab — for 4 MiB
slabs that's ~512 K reads, fast enough for debug.

# ── GPU memory pressure tracking (ported from AMDGPU.jl) ──
# Julia's GC doesn't know about GPU memory. LavaArray wrappers are ~50 bytes on
# the CPU heap, but back 100+ MB of VRAM each. Without pressure signals, GC
# never fires and dead GPU buffers accumulate until OOM.
#
# Strategy mirrors `AMDGPU.jl/src/memory.jl::maybe_collect`:
#   * Pressure-based trigger (`live / heap_size`), not raw byte counter, so the
#     same logic works for 8 GiB iGPUs and 24 GiB dGPUs without tuning.
#   * GC-rate budget: collector skips itself when it has already spent more than
#     ~5% of wall time in GC (`last_gc_time / dt`).  Budget doubles on high
#     pressure, on blocking calls, and after a productive collection.
#   * Only `GC.gc(false)` (incremental) is ever called automatically — full GC
#     is too expensive to fire from the alloc hot path; if we're truly OOM the
#     caller's retry loop in `vk_alloc` runs the full GC explicitly.
#   * EWMA on `last_gc_time` so a single slow GC doesn't permanently inhibit
#     future GCs.
#
# `pool.live_bytes` is incremented by `try_vk_alloc` (real Vulkan allocations,
# including pool blocks) and decremented by `destroy_buffer!`.  Sub-pool chunks
# don't move this counter — the pool block they live in already accounts for
# the VRAM.

# Absolute-capacity pool trim.
#
# `maybe_collect`'s pressure gate is a *ratio* against the device heap, which is
# the wrong signal for holding on to dead pool blocks on an iGPU: 3 GB of empty
# blocks is only ~20 % of a large shared heap, so the gate never trips — but that
# 3 GB is system RAM the rest of the machine still needs, and the pool is only
# handed back on an OOM retry. Long multi-scene runs therefore accumulate
# gigabytes of blocks that nothing will ever reclaim.
#
# So trim on absolute dead capacity as well, rate-limited so a render loop can't
# pay for it repeatedly. Blocks only become empty once the GC has run their
# sub-allocations' finalizers, hence the collection before the scan.

# A sub-allocation is returned to its block by a **finalizer**, so a block only
# becomes empty once those have run — which is what the paragraph above says, and
# what `GC.gc(false)` does not do. Julia's incremental collection sweeps the
# young generation and leaves older objects, and a pool chunk that has survived a
# few frames is exactly an older object. So the scan below almost always found
# nothing and the trim almost never fired: the pool ratcheted up to its
# transient high-water mark and stayed there for the life of the process.
#
# Measured on SAM 2.1: encode then 20 decodes reached 2 096 MiB live with two
# empty 64 MiB blocks that no automatic path would return. A full collection
# followed by `reclaim_empty_pool_blocks!` handed back 128 MiB.
#
# So escalate: try the cheap collection first, and if it finds no empty block,
# pay for a full one — but on its own, longer, timer. A full GC is the expensive
# part (tens of ms on a heap this size) and a render loop must not pay it every
# five seconds; unbounded pool growth is the worse of the two, but not by so much
# that it justifies a hitch per frame.

The order is the point. `drain_deferred_frees!` releases a chunk once its

that only *read* it, nor about commands already recorded into the batch still
being built — and a graph evaluator does almost nothing else: every weight and
every activation is read by the next layer without being written. Draining (or
reclaiming a block those chunks belong to) while such a batch is open destroys a
VkBuffer out from under queued work, and the damage surfaces later and
elsewhere: `sync_access!: buffer is not ALIVE` on a subsequent submit, a
batch-signal desync, or a segfault inside the driver's `vkCmdPipelineBarrier`.

Flushing first makes the invariant unconditional — after it there is no
recorded-but-unsubmitted work and everything submitted has completed — and it
only runs once an allocation has already failed, so the stall is free in the
steady state. `pool.reclaiming` guards the re-entry through `flush!`'s own

Subclasses per octave above [`POOL_SUBDIV_MIN`]: a size class is
`2^p * (1 + s/8)` rather than just `2^p`, so rounding wastes at most 1/8 of a
request instead of at most half of it.

Measured on SAM 2's encoder, which is the workload that made this worth doing.
One encode asks the pool for 1 649 MiB across 787 allocations; with plain
powers of two it was handed **2 781 MiB — 59.3% efficient**, and the missing
1 132 MiB is most of the gap between this allocator's footprint and PyTorch's.
Eight subclasses put that at ~94% for 5x more free lists, which are empty
vectors and cost nothing.

Below `POOL_SUBDIV_MIN` the subdivision is skipped: an octave there is a few
kilobytes, the absolute waste is irrelevant, and the step would fall under the
16-byte alignment every chunk relies on (`block.bump` advances by the class
size, so the class size *is* the alignment guarantee).

"""
    pool(ctx).soft_cap

Pool footprint in bytes past which `pool_alloc` collects *before* committing
another block. `0` disables it.

This is the cheap half of keeping the pool small, and it is deliberately not
the same mechanism as [`maybe_trim_pool!`]:

  * here we run a **GC and reuse** — no queue drain, no Vulkan call, and the
    memory comes back as free-list chunks the caller immediately takes, so this
    can afford to run on the allocation path;
  * there we **destroy blocks** and hand the VkDeviceMemory back, which needs
    `quiesce_before_reclaim!` and therefore stalls the GPU — so it is limited by
    elapsed time and skipped entirely unless a block is actually empty.

Preventing growth and releasing dead capacity are different problems: this one
keeps a steady workload's footprint flat, that one is what stops a finished
workload from holding memory the rest of the machine needs.

Without a trigger here the only backstop is `maybe_collect`, whose pressure
threshold is a fraction of the *device heap* — 0.75 x 20 GiB on this card. That
is a fine OOM guard and a terrible footprint policy: SAM 2's encoder ran to a
stable **16 136 MiB across 200 blocks**, none of it needed, simply because
nothing asked the GC a question until 15 GiB. The same loop with this cap holds
its working set instead. A GPU shared with an editor and a REPL is the normal
case here, not a dedicated one.

2 GiB is where SAM 2's encoder stops caring, measured (blocks / VRAM / p50 / min):

    3.00 GiB   48   4615 MB   340.2   332.2
    2.00 GiB   32   3541 MB   339.8   328.8     <- same speed, 1 GiB less
    1.50 GiB   30   3407 MB   374.0   347.9     <- 10% slower for 134 MB
    1.25 GiB   30   3407 MB   375.4   356.3

collect and every allocation past it pays for a collection and grows anyway.

Unified CPU↔GPU buffer copy — single entry point for every host-visible

Fast path (BAR memory): direct memcpy via `managed.mapped_ptr` after
`wait_for_write(managed)` drains any in-flight writer.  No staging, no batch.

Slow path (device-local): allocate staging, record `cmd_copy_buffer!` into
the active batch, flush, and memcpy between staging and host.  For downloads
we route the copy through the queue that last wrote `managed` so the copy
piggy-backs on producer dispatches (one fence wait instead of two).  For
uploads we use the buffer's ctx default queue.

The caller is responsible for keeping `host_ptr`'s backing array alive
(typically via `GC.@preserve`).
